# A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a browser-based demonstration of the A* pathfinding algorithm. You can place a start and end point on the grid, draw obstacles, and watch the algorithm calculate the optimal path in real time. Adjustable animation speed and optional diagonal movement let you explore how different settings affect the search.

## Features
- Interactive grid for placing start/end points and obstacles
- A* visualization that highlights visited nodes and the final shortest path
- Controls to start, clear, and reset the board
- Configurable animation speed and optional diagonal traversal
- Live statistics showing visited nodes, path length, and elapsed time

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Drag the start and end nodes to the desired cells.
3. Click and drag on the grid to create obstacles.
4. Adjust the animation speed or enable diagonal movement if needed.
5. Press **Start Algorithm** to watch the search unfold.
6. Use **Clear Grid** or **Reset Path** to try new scenarios.
